#Welcome To Your Spotify!
You will be recreating your own Spotify playlist that includes all your favorite songs!

##Before you begin
Please create a mockup of your playlist for an instructor to approve :)

##Set-up your files
Please create the following files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- README.md

Create a link tag for your CSS stylesheet in your HTML document.

##HTML
1. Create a header containing the name of your playlist using a **header** tag.

2. Create a playlist container for all of your songs using a **div** tag and create an id attribute with the value of "playlist-songs".

3. Create at least 5 different songs using a **div** tag and for each song, create a class attribute with the value of "individual-songs".

4. For each song:
  - Cretae a Header containing the song's name using a **header** tag smaller than **h2**.
  - Create a **div** tag and set the value of the id attribute to the album's name.
  - Using a **paragraph** tag, create a description for each song that includes the artist and album name.

*BONUS* Wouldn't it be cool if each song played the actual music? Add an audio tag to each playlist song.

##CSS
1. Set the background color of the body to any dark color using the `element` selector.

2. Add the album cover with `id` selector.

3. Change the styles of the individual pet profiles using the `class` selector.
  - Align all the pet profiles and their content to the center of their container element.
  - Set all pet profile photos to the same size.

4. Modify your elements with these style attributes:
  - `background-color`
  - `color`
  - `font-size`
  - `font-family`
  - `height`
  - `text-align`
  - `width`

*Stretch Goals:*
  - Add the green "SUFFLE PLAY" button at the top
  - Add a cover picture for your playlist
  - Play music when clicking on that song
